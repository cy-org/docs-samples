                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sample will show you how to create, issue and consume a custom security token
                    in an ASP.NET Web Application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition this sample shows the basics of how claims have been integrated into
                    the .NET framework. You will learn how a web application is enabled to use WIF.
                    You will see how they are useful from within existing properties and functions,
                    and how you can take the next step to using them directly using the ClaimsPrincipal
                    class in System.Security.Claims. You also will also learn how to work with the local
                    STS that is part of the Identity and Access tool for Visual Studio 11.
                </p>
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>
                    You must have the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=245849">Identity and
                        Access Tool for Visual Studio 11</a>installed. You can find this via the Extension
                    Manager or download it directly from Visual Studio Gallery.
                </p>
                <h3>How To Run</h3>
                <p>
                    To run this sample, start Visual Studio 11 as administrator, open the project, and
                    run the project by hitting F5. If you are on this page via F5 here is a link to
                    <a href="./">run the sample</a>. When you do you will be redirected from the web
                    application to an STS to logon. The STS will accept any credentials, enter any user
                    name, password is not required. The STS will then redirect you back to the web application
                    where you will see the user name displayed in the header and in the body of the
                    page, a table of the issued claims as well as the raw token.
                </p>
                <h3>Custom Token Details</h3>
                <p>
                    This sample is already configured to use the custom STS in the PassiveSTS project
                    that is part of this solution. All of the required settings are present in the web.config
                    of the Relying Party project. In the Relying Party project web.config look at the
                    section system.identityModel\identityConfiguration\issuerTokenResolver. There you
                    will see a custom type specified of SimpleWebToken.CustomIssuerTokenResolver that
                    is defined in the SimpleWebToken class library that is part of this solution. That
                    class library is also used by the PassiveSTS for defining the format of the token
                    that it issues.
                </p>
                <h3>Claims Usage Details</h3>
                <p>
                    This sample includes the following projects.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>PassiveSTS</em>, this is a basic implementation of an identity provider security
                        token service. It issues a custom token format defined in the SimpleWebToken project
                        that is also part of this application. Note that it only requires a user name to
                        issue a token to help illustrate the concepts, not best practices. This code should
                        not be used in a production STS ‘as is’. </li>
                    <li><em>RelyingParty</em>, this is a WebApplication project that is secured by the STS
                        in the PassiveSTS project. </li>
                    <li><em>SimpleWebToken</em>, this is a class library that defines our custom token format.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This sample has already been configured to use WIF via the required sections to
                    the web.config. Take a look at the system.identitymodel and system.identitymodel.services
                    sections in the web.config.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the body of the page the name is displayed using the Page.User.Identity.Name
                    property. In the header the name is displayed using the LoginName control. The value
                    itself is from a claim that the Windows Identity Foundation processed from a security
                    token and integrated into the current user principal. Other claims can also be sent
                    in a security token. These claims can be accessed directly, for example the email
                    address displayed in the body is another claim in the security token. That is accessed
                    in the code behind of default.aspx page by creating a ClaimsPrincipal from the current
                    user. You can see all of the claims returned in the security token below in the
                    GridView where we have used the ClaimsPrincipal as the data source in the code behind.
                    The raw token is displayed at the bottom of the page via retrieving the bootstrapContext.Token.
                    Note this is possible as in web.config the system.IdentityModel\identityConfiguration
                    attribute saveBootstrapToken was set to true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So where is the user in this sample from? Where are they being authenticated? This
                    sample is configured to use an STS from the PassiveSTS project that is part of this
                    solution. As this is used only for testing it does not actually authenticate a user.
                    It simply issues a security token with the claims it is configured with whenever
                    an application asks. Note that it accepts any user name entered on its Login page,
                    password is not required. DO NOT use this STS sample code ‘as is’ in production
                    code.

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>I get an error from the Local STS when I hit F5</em></p>
                        <p>
                            You need to run VS in admin mode to use the Local STS as it needs to be able to
                            open ports to function.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>When examining the web.config intellisense is flagging sections of system.identitymodel
                                and system.identitymodel.services as invalid.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a product bug in the Beta release where the intellisense does not match
                            the actual config. This is being fixed in the next release. You can find the proper

                <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    For illustrative purposes this sample application shows all the parameters of claims
                    (i.e. claim types and claim values), which are issued by a security token service
                    (STS). In production code, security implications of echoing the properties of claims
                    should be carefully considered. For example, some of the security considerations
                    are: (i) accepting only claim types that are expected by the applications; (ii)
                    sanitizing the claim parameters before using them; and (iii) filtering out claims
                    that may contain sensitive personal information. DO NOT use this sample code ‘as
                    is’ in production code.
