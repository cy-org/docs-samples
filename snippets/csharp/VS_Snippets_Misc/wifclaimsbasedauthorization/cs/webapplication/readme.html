                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This sample will show you how to use the Claims Authorization Module provided by
                    WIF for enabling claims based authorization. You will see how to create a class
                    for use with the Claims Authorization Manager to specify policy in config for controlling
                    access to pages in an ASP.NET Web Application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition this sample shows the basics of how claims have been integrated into
                    the .NET framework. You will learn how a web application is enabled to use WIF.
                    You will see how they are useful from within existing properties and functions,
                    and how you can take the next step to using them directly using the ClaimsPrincipal
                    class in System.Security.Claims. You also will also learn how to work with the local
                    STS that is part of the Identity and Access tool for Visual Studio 11.
                </p>
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>
                    You must have the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=245849">Identity and
                        Access Tool for Visual Studio 11</a>installed. You can find this via the Extension
                    Manager or download it directly from Visual Studio Gallery.
                </p>
                <h3>How To Run</h3>
                <p>
                    To run this sample, start Visual Studio 11 as administrator, open the project, and
                    run the project by hitting F5. If you are on this page via F5 here is a link to
                    <a href="./">run the sample</a>. This page allows anonymous access, the other pages
                    in this web application require authentication and specific claim types for access.
                    By default this application is configured to use the Local STS that will issue claims
                    to you as soon as authentication in the application is required. By default you
                    should be able to access the <a href="Developers.aspx">Developers page</a>. You
                    should not initially be able to access the <a href="Administrators.aspx">Administrators
                        page</a>, if you try you will get a 401 unauthorized error. You can see the
                    claims associated with your user <a href="Claims.aspx">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Claims Authorization Details</h3>
                <p>
                    Access to the pages is controlled via web.config settings for specific claim values
                    using an implementation of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.claims.claimsauthorizationmanager(VS.110).aspx"
                        target="_blank">ClaimsAuthorizationManager class</a>that is part of WIF. You
                    can change the claims issued to you via the Identity and Access extension or directly
                    in the Local STS config. For this project there are commented claim values for you
                    to uncomment to allow access to the <a href="Administrators.aspx">Administrators page
                    </a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Claims Authorization Module is enabled in the web.config. One enabled you can
                    then specify the policies and class to process the claims authorization decisions
                    in system.identityModel\identityConfiguration\claimsAuthorizationManager. There
                    you can see that the type has been set to ClaimsAuthorizationLibrary.MyClaimsAuthorizationManager
                    that is defined in the ClaimsAuthorizationLibrary project in the solution. The specific
                    policies of which claims are required for access to a page are specified within
                    the policy subelement.
                </p>
                <h3>Claims Usage Details</h3>
                <p>
                    This sample has already been configured to use WIF via the Identity and Access tool
                    which added the required sections to the web.config. Take a look at the configuration
                    tab in the tool by choosing Identity and Access option from the project context
                    menu, or look at the system.identitymodel and system.identitymodel.services sections
                    in the web.config.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the body of the page the name is displayed using the Page.User.Identity.Name
                    property. In the header the name is displayed using the LoginName control. The value
                    itself is from a claim that the Windows Identity Foundation processed from a security
                    token and integrated into the current user principal. Other claims can also be sent
                    in a security token. These claims can be accessed directly, for example the email
                    address displayed in the body is another claim in the security token. That is accessed
                    in the code behind of default.aspx page by creating a ClaimsPrincipal from the current
                    user. You can see all of the claims returned in the security token below in the
                    GridView where we have used the ClaimsPrincipal as the data source in the code behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So where is the user in this sample from? Where are they being authenticated? This
                    sample is configured to use the Local STS that is part of the Identity and Access
                    Tool for Visual Studio 11. The Local STS is an Identity Provider for testing purposes
                    so you can build your application without needing to configure or connect to an
                    Identity Provider. As this is used only for testing it does not actually authenticate
                    a user. It simply issues a security token with the claims it is configured with
                    whenever an application asks. You can configure the Local STS from the Identity
                    and Access context menu to add other claims, set a different port or an alternate
                    token type.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>I get an error from the Local STS when I hit F5</em></p>
                        <p>
                            You need to run VS in admin mode to use the Local STS as it needs to be able to
                            open ports to function.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>When examining the web.config intellisense is flagging sections of system.identitymodel
                                and system.identitymodel.services as invalid.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a product bug in the Beta release where the intellisense does not match
                            the actual config. This is being fixed in the next release. You can find the proper

                <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    For illustrative purposes this sample application shows all the parameters of claims
                    (i.e. claim types and claim values), which are issued by a security token service
                    (STS). In production code, security implications of echoing the properties of claims
                    should be carefully considered. For example, some of the security considerations
                    are: (i) accepting only claim types that are expected by the applications; (ii)
                    sanitizing the claim parameters before using them; and (iii) filtering out claims
                    that may contain sensitive personal information. DO NOT use this sample code ‘as
                    is’ in production code.
